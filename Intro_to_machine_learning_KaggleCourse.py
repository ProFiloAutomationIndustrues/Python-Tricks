Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
Predict: Just what it sounds like
Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
